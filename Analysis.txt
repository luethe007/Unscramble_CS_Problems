Task 0
Prints out the information of first record of texts and last record of calls.

Time Complexity: Worst-case time complexity is O(1)
The time complexity for this program is O(1) because we are accessing the first and last values from the lists (calls and texts) by an index.

Task 1
Prints number of distinct telephone numbers in the dataset.

Time Complexity: Worst-case time complexity is O(1)
The time complexity for this program is O(1) because we first transpose the calls and texts datasets using built-in functions.
Then, we use sets to calculate the count of phone numbers.

Task 2
Prints the phone number that spent the longest time on the phone and the total time in seconds they spend on phone call.

Time Complexity: Worst-case time complexity is O(n)
The time complexity for this program is O(n) as we iterate over all calls to sum up the durations by phone number.
The rest of the code is executed once and negligible.

Task 3
Prints the phone codes called by fixed-line numbers in Bangalore and the percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore that are to fixed lines in Bangalore.

Time Complexity: 
The time complexity for get_area_codes in Task3.py is O(nlogn) because we use the sorted() function.
The time complexity for get_bangalore_ratio in Task3.py is O(n) because we loop through the calls. The rest of the code is executed once.

Task 4
Prints the list of numbers that could be telemarketers.

Time Complexity: Worst-case time complexity is O(nlogn)
The time complexity for get_telemarketers is O(nlogn) because we use the sorted() function.
