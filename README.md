# Unscramble CS Problems

In this project, I deconstruct a series of open-ended problems into smaller components (e.g. inputs, outputs, series of functions).  

I will work on five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016.

## Data

The text and call data are provided in csv files.

The text data (text.csv) has the following columns: sending telephone number (string), receiving telephone number (string), timestamp of text message (string).  

The call data (call.csv) has the following columns: calling telephone number (string), receiving telephone number (string), start timestamp of telephone call (string), duration of telephone call in seconds (string).

## Efficiency
In the *Analysis.txt* file, I analyze the time-complexity of the provided Python code.
